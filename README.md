## Business Request

As a Data Analyst for a UK TVÂ channel, I was asked to obtain Covid data in order to assist them in answering the following questions for a Covid special that would air the following week on November 19th. The information required was:

- Mortality rate of the UK and compare it with that of Spain.
- What is the percentage of people that have been infected in the UK?
- What are the top 3 countries with the highest infection rates per capita?
- What are the top 3 countries with the highest death count per capita?
- What are the top 3 continents with the highest death count?
- When has been the day with the highest number of deaths thus far? Global and national (UK only) numbers.
- What are the 3 countries with the lowest vaccination rate?

## Overview

- Data was obtained from the [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus) website on 10th November 2021.
- Creation of schema and tables, and import of data into SQL Server.
- Perform data analysis to answer the business request questions.
- Build an interactive dashboard on [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/david.gomez5813/viz/ProjectPortfolio_16368118123250/CovidAnalysisDashboard).

## Conclusions

- As of the date of this analysis, 2021/11/10, the chances of dying from coronavirus in the UK are just a bit over 1.5% percent while the probability jumps up to over 3.5% in the African country of Zimbabwe. This may be an indicator of a lower tier public health system, with less capacity to fight over the disease.For other developed countries, like Spain, the probability is slightly higher than that of the UK, with an infection fatality rate of 1.74%.
- At the time of this analysis, 13.86% of the population has been infected in the UK.
- Montenegro has the highest percentage of infections, with 23.93% of its population having had coronavirus, followed by Seychelles and Andorra, with 22.77% and 20.35%, respectively.
- Peruvian people suffered the greatest impact, with a death count per capita of 0.6%. Eastern European countries, Bulgaria, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, had 0.37% and 0.36% of its people die from covid.
- Surprisingly, North America has the highest death count, followed by South America and Asia. Quite alarming that the US, with only 7.6% of the world population share, is top in the list.
- The number of deaths attributed to the coronavirus was the highest in the world on January, 20 2021, with 18,007 deaths in a single day. Similarly, the UK had its greatest fatality count on the same day, with 1,826 deaths.
- Low-income African countries, Algeria, Burundi and Cameroon, have the lowest vaccination rates in the world as of 2021/11/10.
